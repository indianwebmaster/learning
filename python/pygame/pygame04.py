# Transformed as a class

# In pygame, everything is viewed on a single user-created display, which can be a window or a full screen.
# The display is created using .set_mode(), which returns a Surface representing the visible part of the window.
# It is this Surface that you pass into drawing functions like pygame.draw.circle(), and the contents of that Surface
# are pushed to the display when you call pygame.display.flip()

import pygame
# Import pygame.locals for easier access to key coordinates
from pygame.locals import (K_UP, K_DOWN, K_LEFT, K_RIGHT, K_ESCAPE, KEYDOWN, QUIT)

# CONSTANTS
SCREEN_WIDTH,SCREEN_HEIGHT = 800,600

# How do you know if an obstacle has collided with the player?
# What happens when the obstacle flies off the screen?
# What if you want to draw background images that also move?
# What if you want your images to be animated?
#       You can handle all these situations and more with sprites.
#
# In programming terms, a sprite is a 2D representation of something on the screen.
# Essentially, itâ€™s a picture.
# pygame provides a Sprite class, which is designed to hold one or several graphical representations of any game object
# that you want to display on the screen.
# To use it, you create a new class that extends Sprite
